# storagegrid_bucket (Resource)

Create a new bucket - a resource



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the bucket

### Optional

- `object_lock_configuration` (Block, Optional) Object Lock configuration for the bucket. Can only be set when creating a new bucket. If object locking is supposed to be disabled, omit the object lock configuration.

**Note:**
- Specify either 'days' or 'years', but not both if object locking is enabled.
- If object locking is enabled, object versioning will be enabled by default as well.
  It's safe to provide a "storagegrid_bucket_versioning" resource with status "Enabled" additionally. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--object_lock_configuration))
- `region` (String) The region of the bucket, defaults to the StorageGRID's default region

<a id="nestedblock--object_lock_configuration"></a>
### Nested Schema for `object_lock_configuration`

Optional:

- `days` (Number) The number of days for which objects in the bucket are retained.
- `mode` (String) The object lock retention mode. Can be 'compliance' or 'governance'.
- `years` (Number) The number of years for which objects in the bucket are retained.
