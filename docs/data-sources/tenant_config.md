### Nested Schema for `account`

Read-Only:

- `capabilities` (Set of String) The high-level features enabled for this account, such as S3 or Swift protocols (accounts must have the 'management' capability if users will sign into the Tenant Manager)
- `id` (String) A unique identifier for the account (automatically assigned when an account is created)
- `name` (String) The descriptive name specified for the account (this name is for display only and might not be unique)
- `policy` (Attributes) Settings for the tenant account (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account--policy))
- `replica` (Boolean) Automatically assigned when generating the response. Ignored in the PUT body. Present only if this tenant account has permission to use a grid federation connection. If true, this account on the local grid is a replica of an account created on another grid. If false, this account was created on the local grid and is not a copy.
