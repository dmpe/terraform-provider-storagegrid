# NetApp storagegrid Provider

This unofficial NetApp provider can be used to interact with [StorageGrid](https://www.netapp.com/data-storage/storagegrid/) system.
StorageGrid is a hardware or virtual appliance which provides support for Amazon S3 object storage protocol.

It is import to note that this provider only assumes to work against "TENANT" REST API - not the administrative "GRID" REST API.

See also provider's documentation on GitHub, and on [NetApp](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/storagegrid-family/).

## Example Provider Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    storagegrid = {
      source  = "dmpe/storagegrid"
      version = "" # My strong advice - always pin this provider's version!
    }
  }
}

provider "storagegrid" {
  address   = "https://grid.firm.com:9443"
  username  = "grid"
  password  = "change_me"
  tenant    = "<int>" # Tenant ID
  insecure  = false
}
```

### Using environmental variables

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    storagegrid = {
      source  = "dmpe/storagegrid"
      version = "" # My strong advice - always pin this provider's version!
    }
  }
}

provider "storagegrid" {
}
```
